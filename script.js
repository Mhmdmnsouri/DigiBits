Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), not only provides an incentive structure similar to Bitcoin (BTC) in securing and maintaining the network but is also used as “gas” to run transactions through smart contracts.

While research in shared ledger technology goes back decades, the arrival of the Bitcoin blockchain introduced the first distributed ledger technology that was thoroughly decentralized and resistant to censorship, seizure and collusion. Blockchain technology, in its various manifestations including the Ethereum blockchain and others, is ultimately a global consensus system — i.e., it allows people to coordinate and cooperate around a neutral source of information without trusting each other or a central administrator.

No value is forfeited if a person trades any given paper U.S. dollar for a different paper U.S. dollar. On the other hand, something such as artwork is generally nonfungible. The “Mona Lisa” is not of equal value to “The Persistence of Memory,” as both artworks are unique, deriving value as such. Based on distributed ledger technology, NFT crypto assets serve as a method of authentication for buyers of unique items, proving aspects such as ownership. NFTs became much more well known in 2020 and 2021. NFTs have potential for other use cases as well, such as companies tracking their internal resources or platforms verifying subscriptions and use.'

With the help of distributed ledger technology, or DLT, DeFi solutions offer a number of the same opportunities, but they are controlled by a large number of participants who abide by rules enforced by smart contracts. DeFi solutions also often give greater flexibility in terms of users’ ability to store and control their own assets.
